        <!-- ======= Main Paragraph Text ======= -->
        <p class="leader">Back in February 2021, I was planning a getaway for myself and my girlfriend for her birthday, the first one we would be taking in months, as two weeks had passed since we received our second dose of the COVID 
          vaccine. She told me that she didn't care where we went, as long as there was a beach, a place to sit and eat privately, and plenty of sun. She also ruled out Pismo Beach as an option, as we had been there last year and she was
          placing a heavy emphasis on going to new places. After some research, I settled on Cambria, CA, which is about an hour north of Pismo Beach. I read that it was much more laid back than Pismo (if you've ever been there, you know 
          that there are always A LOT of people), and that the beaches there were much less crowded. I narrowed my search to hotels and inns along Moonstone Beach Drive, which is just steps from the beach. Eventually I booked a  stay at the 
          Captain's Cove Inn, which is a small 5 room inn, perfect for a socially distant getaway.
        </p>
        <p class="leader">We spent most of the afternoon of our first full day in Cambria just loafing around on the beach with some beach chairs that were provided in our room. There were hardly any other people around at all, although that could have been
          due to a lot of people still staying away due to COVID. The weather was pretty good considering it was still technically winter. We actually forgot to bring water with us on our way down to the beach, but our room at the inn was so nearby, I only
          spent a couple of minutes making the journey back to get our bottles. If only I could be that close to the beach all of the time!

            worth the drive over to Cayucos! They had some of the best seafood I've ever had. I usually don't like cocktail sauce, but their house cocktail sauce went perfectly with their breaded shrimp.

          </div><p>A photo of Burton Drive in Cambria's East Village that I found online (and it's in the public domain!) There are a surprising amount of antique stores packed into East Village, and I was able to check out a few of them during our trip. We 
            also visited Oliver's Twist, which is a gift shop that sells unique items. They had a lot of vases, pottery, and lamps that were all very different from what I'd see in a chain store. They even had a section for funny greeting cards.

          </div><p>While going for a walk on Moonstone Beach, we found this rather large bit of driftwood. Truthfully, it's really more like an entire tree than driftwood. When I saw it, I took a picture of it and sent it to my dad, since I had heard him say once
            or twice that he was interested in going to the coast sometime to look for driftwood. Unfortunately, this piece was much too big to consider bringing back!
