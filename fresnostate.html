        <p class="leader">Although I went to Fresno State for two years after transferring from Fresno City College, I never actually went to any Fresno State games while I was still in school. I didn't start going until about two years
          later, in the fall of 2015, when I actually started taking a greater interest in sports in general. I had just started watching NFL games since the prior year, and started watching NBA games that year, so I turned my interest 
          towards Fresno State, as well. I found that I could get season tickets for Fresno State Men's Basketball for about $200 (there was a special for young alumni going on), so I immediately jumped at the chance. My
          dad and I started going to the games that fall, and with the exception of the past two years, we have gone to just about every single home game. Below are two of the best games I attended in person:

        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center"><b>Fresno State vs. San Diego State - Feb 10, 2016</b>
        </p>
        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">This game had been hyped up extensively in the days before the game by Fresno State Athletics. San Diego State had beaten the Bulldogs in San Diego and were still undefeated in the Mountain West
        Conference. It was the first "big game" I had ever been to, and it was a must-win for Fresno State to stay atop in the Mountain West rankings. San Diego state largely dominated the game until the final few minutes, when Fresno State
        started to fight back and brought the game within one point. With less than a minute left, Fresno State stole the ball and ran it up court to star senior Marvelle Harris, who took the rock right to the basket and went in for a shot,
        which didn't go in! Luckily, he drew a foul from a San Diego State player, giving him two free throws to try to win the game. 
        </p> 
        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        As Marvelle stepped up to take his free throws, everybody in the Save Mart Center held their breath and went
        as silent as possible. Fresno State players are unusually bad at hitting their free throws - could Marvelle sink both of his to win the game?!? The first one went in easily, and we all cheered. The second one took a bounce, but then
        went right in! Fresno State now led by one! San Diego State took possesion with less than 20 seconds left, ran the ball up the court, went in for their own shot, which missed! One of their players touched the hoop right as the shot 
        missed, which caused the referees to call basket interference, which gave the ball right back to the Bulldogs with 0.8 seconds left! The Dogs' threw a baseball pass to center court to run out the clock, and the game was over! Fresno State 
        had just beaten the #1 team in the Mountain West!

        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center"><b>Paul George Day - Nov 10, 2019</b>
        </p>
        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">The Fresno State Men's Basketball program is really only well-known for two things, winning the NIT in 1983, and producing a top NBA player you may be familiar with, Paul George. So, it was no big surprise
          that Fresno State decided to throw a little Jersey retirement party for Paul George. Paul had played for Fresno State in the mid 2000s, and had found success in the NBA, so he was invited to attend the Jersey Retirement ceremony, where his #24
          Jersey would be retired, and no player could ever use that number again. Paul, still on a road to recovery from a recent injury in the NBA, was able to make it that day, and he and the 8,529 in attendance (myself included) watched as Fresno State 
          proceeded to play one of the best games I've ever attended.
        </p>
        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">The score was close all game. Neither team was able to pull ahead. The score was tied 69-69 with 2:18 left to play. Jarred Hyder, Fresno State's Freshman point guard, went in for a layup, but got fouled by
          Winthrop on the way. He was able to make both of his free throws to make it a 71-69 game. Winthrop took the ball down the court, attempted a three-point shot, which missed. Multiple Fresno State players tried to rebound the ball, but couldn't and
          it ended up back with Wintrop's Chase Claxton, who laid the ball up and in to tie it again at 71-71. Fresno State took the inbound and Jarred Hyder went straight to the 3-point line and made it to push to the score 74-71. Winthrop pushed right
          back with a 3-pointer of their own in just seconds, tying the game 74-74 with just 4.9 seconds left! What happened next is one of my favorite Fresno State Basketball memories of all time. Aguir Agau tossed the ball to Jarred Hyder, who ran to
          the halfcourt logo, before finding Mustafa Lawrence wide open just beyond the 3-point line. With just about a second left, Mustafa leaped up and took the shot, which went in as the timer hit 0 and the buzzer sounded! The Save Mart Center went nuts
          and I remember I shouted "GAME, WINNING, SHOT" at the top of my lungs as I processed what I had just witnessed. It was awesome!
