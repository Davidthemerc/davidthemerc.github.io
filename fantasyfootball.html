        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center leader">This is a picture of Amon-Ra St. Brown. As told by the hero background image of this page, he earned 35.4 fantasy points during my championship week match (the Fantasy Super Bowl.)
          He came out of basically nowhere to completely and utterly dominate the last 3-4 weeks of the regular NFL season, and I had the privilege of adding him to my team just as he reached his peak. I pretty much won it all because of him!
          </p>
          <p class="d-flex justify-content-center leader pb-2">
          Fantasy Football is really a simple concept. You "draft" a group of NFL players at the beginning of the season, and they score points based on their real-life performances throughout the season. If you're lucky, you can draft a team
          of superstars and dominate in your fantasy league. My fantasy league consists of myself and 15 co-workers. I originally started playing Fantasy Football back in 2016 when I had just started working at my current job, at the encouragement
          of my co-workers. We held the "fantasy draft" at Buffalo Wild Wings and it was all great fun. However, I am starting to wonder if they regret inviting me, because since that first year (where I was eliminated in the second round of the
          fantasy playoffs), I have won back-to-back Super Bowls in 2017 & 2018, and 2020 & now 2021, a feat that I don't think will ever be repeated. Ever since I won that first Super Bowl in 2017, I have spent more and more time analyzing NFL
          stats, players, teams, the NFL draft, etc., in hopes of pursuing additional championships. I think I can say I have been fairly successful! It has definitely become an obsession of mine and I can't wait to see just how dominant my "dynasty"
          really can be.

        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">It was a very hard-fought win. I had to watch every single game that week to see if all of my players were doing well, and it went down to the last game where my opponent had players, but I did
          not have any. It was entirely possible that he could have taken the championship on Monday, but my team held on to a nearly 16-point lead at the end of the NFL week!
