        <p class="leader">My girlfriend and I were planning a trip for birthday last year, searching many possible destinations online through Google Maps (not too different from just taking a map of the state and just throwing a dart at a random
          location!) when we happened upon Auburn, CA, which is north of Sacramento. We had never traveled to the greater Sacramento area before, but we weren't really looking to go there, as we wanted a place with a more small-town feel. While searching 
          about the area, we found out about Auburn, CA. Auburn is the county seat of Placer County and was originally a Gold Rush town. As a child, I was always fascinated by the Gold Rush, so when I read that Auburn had multiple gold rush era museums, 
          I quickly jumped at the chance to travel there. We found an Airbnb about 20 minutes outside of Auburn and then started to plan my little birthday getaway.

          </div><p>One of the museums we visited in Auburn was the Gold Country Medical History Museum. They have probably the single largest collection of Gold Rush-era medical devices, equipment, prescription bottles, etc. that are available for viewing
            for the public. Pictured here is a foot-powered dental drill. As the curator told us, you could only hope that your dentist was fleet of foot and had his wits about him, because if he could not drill at a constant, steady rate, you were in for
            a whole lot of pain!

              </div></a>
          </div><p>Pictured here is a colllection of actual Gold-rush era prescriptions written for patients. If you look carefully, you can find a prescription written for, of all things, heroin. One of the prescriptions pre-dates the great San Francisco
            earthquake in 1906 (which probably makes it quite rare, as much of the city burned in the days after!) Another was written only days after the earthquake. The label says it was prescribed for stomach problems. I wonder if the person who got that
            prescription ate some sort of rancid/spoiled food in the days after the earthquake and needed to visit the doctor for a stomach ache.

          </div><p>Out of all the restaurants we ate at in Auburn, my favorite was easily Awful Annie's. It's a breakfast and lunch eatery, though we only had the chance to have breakfast there. My favorite item was probably the bacon flights,
            simply because it offered a variety of different bacon slices to try. Whenever a restaurant offers multiple varieties of something I like, such as bacon, I always wonder about the varieties that I didn't order (since I can't eat everything!)
            Awful Annie's solved that problem for me by offering a bacon flight, which as you can see here consisted of four different types of bacon. And yes, they were all great!
