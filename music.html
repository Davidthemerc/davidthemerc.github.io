        <p class="leader d-flex justify-content-center p-2">I was first introduced to modern Rock Music in the spring and summer of 2008. My friend Robert loaned me a flash drive with copies of all of his current favorite songs. There were multiple
          genres of music on that flash drive; pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, and even some classical music. Up until that point, I hadn't really paid much attention to music, other than what I had heard my mom listening to, which mainly consisted of
          Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Elton John, etc. As a result, I gravitated more towards the rock songs from the flash drive, which were mainly from Linkin Park, Simple Plan, Green Day, and Nirvana. From there, I started looking online for other
          rock and metal bands. I've chosen to feature two of my favorite bands here.

        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <h4 class="metal-subheader">Three Days Grace</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="leader">
          I actually can't remember how I first heard about Three Days Grace, but I suspect that I was browsing YouTube for songs and YouTube eventually provided one of their songs as a recommendation to what I was already listening to. After I heard
          one or two of their songs, I was immediately hooked, and went straight to Amazon to buy their first album (their self-titled album) online. While I'm sure I could have gotten it for free somewhere else, when I really enjoy a band's music I
          make a point of actually supporting the band by buying their music online (and going to concerts when I can.) I also didn't want to wait and look for a "cheaper" method to get their music; I wanted it then and there so I could listen to it,
          so I went directly to Amazon to get the entire album quickly and easily.

        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center"><b>Three Days Grace (Self-Titled Album, 2003)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Three Days Grace's first album is firmly rooted in the post-grunge genre. It especially appealed to me in that first year after high school, where I was attending Fresno City College and really had no clue what I was going to do about my
          future. Don't get me wrong, while I did not dress up in black clothes and makeup and dress like an "emo", there were certain times where I certainly felt like I had a bit of a darker side to me. Their self-titled album reflected
          perfectly how I felt about my life at the time.
        </p>

        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center"><b>One-X (2006)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          After I had thoroughly listened to their self-titled album, I looked up the band online and found that they also had a second album available from 2006. Unfortunately, by this time, I was considerably more broke and had to get a copy from
          a friend (oh how quickly our moral values go when we are broke sometimes!) I loaded up the album on my new Sansa Fuze MP3 player that I had received for my birthday and began binge listening to it. I felt that it was a perfect sequel to
          their self-titled album, and while they had moved away from their post-grunge roots a bit, their overall sound still matched perfectly with how I was feeling around that time.

        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <h4 class="metal-subheader">Five Finger Death Punch</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          This band was personally recommended to me by one of my friends, and just about everybody in our group was raving about them. Five Finger Death Punch is a Heavy Metal/Groove Metal band and has a completely differently style than Three Days
          Grace. Whereas TDG is more of a post-grunge band, FFDP is much heavier music, with heavy emphasis on screams and guitar work. Five Finger Death Punch's music has much more of a dramatic flair to it. Although the two bands are quite different 
          in style, they were both well suited for my overall mood at the time.

        <p class="d-flex justify-content-center"><b>Way of the Fist (2007)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Way of the Fist was  my first real experience with a metal album. Although it is FFDP's first album, if you had asked me before I knew about the band, I probably would not have been able to believe that it was their first album. The
          guitar solos on the album are killer. Way of the Fist was probably my 3rd most listened to album after the two Three Days Grace albums I was also listening to on repeat at the time. Luckily, I did not have to wait too long for more
          music from the band, as their next album was going to be released the next year. FFDP is the band that made me actively research to find out when new music from my favorite bands  would be coming out, which is something that I still 
          do to this day. Their next album is coming later in 2022, which I eagerly await.

        </p>
        <p>
          There are actually two albums between Way of the Fist and this one, but The Wrong Side of Heaven and the Righteous Side of Hell, Volume 1 was much more impactful for me than their two middle albums had been. The album released a couple
          months into what turned out to be my longest "summer vacation" ever - the period of time between my college graduation in May 2013 and getting my first job in December 2013. It was an extremely frustrating time for me, trying to get a 
          full-time job somewhere, anywhere. Whenever I blasted this music through my speakers, it was like the band was talking directly to me, understanding my frustrations and sharing theirs with me as well.
