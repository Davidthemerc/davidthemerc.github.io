        <p class="leader">I was born in Downey, California (a suburb of Los Angeles) about one score and some change ago. I went to Rio Hondo Elementary school for kindergarten through fifth grade. The six years I spent there were the longest I ever 
          spent at any single school. We had annual water ballon fights in 2nd and 3rd grade, which were upgraded to water <i>gun</i> fights in 4th and 5th grade. Looking back, I had a lot of fun in those years, we really used our imaginations to the
          limit in those early years. There was one day, in 4th grade, when a swarm of bees accidentally found its way onto the playground, and everybody ran like hell to get away. Later that day, a group of us met up at afternoon recess to "investigate"
          where the bees came from. Somebody said they were Mexican killer bees, which apparently was a big scare at the time. We didn't really have any way of knowing, so we all just sort of accepted that thought. We later found the bees over by the
          school fence, which separated the school from the park, and told the school where they were. The bees disappeared after that; they probably either flew away, or maybe the school called somebody to come pick them up. Either way, it was a pretty
          interesting memory.
        </p>
        <p class="leader">My dad used to take me with him to work on the weekends, which was really a side job of stocking and maintaining all of the vending machines that his bosses let him keep there. He worked at several garment factories, and the 
          vending machines were mainly used by the garment workers. He used to keep a steady supply of sodas in snacks in my closet, which we would take with us on the weekends to resupply the machines. I became an older brother at six years old, and 
          mercifully only ended up having one brother. One was enough!

        <p class="leader">My favorite thing to do with my dad was to visit the computer swap meets that were held once or twice a month in Redondo Beach and Santa Ana. Since I was 5, we'd always had a desktop computer at home. As I got older, my dad and I
          started going to these swap meets, and we'd go around the entire swap meet, buying various Macintosh parts until I eventually had an entire system. I went through several different systems over the years, upgrading at least once as year as better
          computer components started showing up at the swap meet. It was during these times that my love of computers was formed.

              and as I recall, did not work 100% of the time. Having a good CD-ROM drive was a must, as all the good games were on CD-ROM!
