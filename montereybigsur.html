        <!-- ======= Main Paragraph Text ======= -->
        <p class="leader">The area around Monterey and Big Sur is probably one of the picturesque places along the entire California central coast that I have ever been to, but on this particular occasion, I managed to forget my camera. I had it all ready 
          to go, but left the carrying case hanging on my door right before I went out to the car. I was able to snap a pretty good photo of the creek at the Big Sur River Inn with my phone (see above), but a lot of the other photos I took weren't so
          great. My girlfriend had been telling me all year that she wanted to go to Big Sur, but the weather and our work schedules hadn't really been cooperating. Near the end of May 2021, our window to travel there finally opened. We booked a hotel in
          Salinas, CA to save on money for the rest of our trip, and from there we were able to visit both Monterey and Big Sur.

              </div></a>
          </div><p>Our first stop on the trip was the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in Monterey, CA. Yes, this is probably the most touristy place that we could have gone to, but it's a place that I had yet to check off my "list". We reserved a spot in "line" on
            Yelp and waited about half an hour to be seated. While their seafood wasn't as good as Splash Cafe in Pismo or the Sea Shanty in Cayucos, it was still pretty good.  I've always been a fan of Forest Gump and going to Bubba Gumps was always
            something that I wanted to do. We made sure to get some collectible cups with our meal, as well.

              </div></a>
          </div><p>Later that same afternoon, after we checked in at the hotel, my girlfriend and I made plans to visit Big Sur the next day. We planned to head to the Big Sur River Inn, which has a restaurant with creekside seating. We arrived a little
            after 2 PM, well after any lunch rush. The River Inn was taking orders and serving them up inside handheld coolers, which we could take and seat ourselves outside anywhere. My girfriend had brought her picnic blanket, and once we got our
            food, we sat over in the grass near the creek. There was even a live musician performing nearby. The weather was perfect, and all the trees gave us plenty of shade. After we finished our food, we took the cooler back to the restaurant and went
            over to the creek and sat on a bench, which is where I took the creek photo.

          </div><p>The 17-Mile drive is something we actually did on a previous trip to Monterey, but I felt it is noteworthy enough to mention here. The drive is another one of those must-do things in the area, as it takes you around the coastline of the
            entire area. We entered the drive from the Pacific Grove entrance in the north and headed west. There were a few beaches along the route, but many of them were so packed that we did not have a chance to stop there. Probably the most notable 
            place on the drive is the Pebble Beach Golf Course. If entering the drive from Pacific Grove, you will eventually end up near Carmel, CA. We looked for a place to eat in Carmel, but many of the places were a bit too busy for our liking, so we
            ended up eating in nearby Seaside, about a 10 minute drive away.
