        <!-- ======= Main Paragraph Text ======= -->
        <p class="leader">I started as a Staff Analyst in July 2016, working for the Department of Behavioral Health. It has proven to be a challenging, engaging job with supportive co-workers, with a very friendly, almost family-like working environment.
          My new boss, Diana, was impressed with my writing sample and how I had interviewed, and was eager to have me working for her division. I was equally eager to use my varied skillset to excel at my job. When I first applied for the job, I was actually
          pretty nervous, not being sure what I would be doing, not really sure if I was suited to that job, or if I would even be able to handle the work, but as my first few weeks as a Staff Analyst flew by, I was able to adjust quickly and truly shine for
          probably the first time in my life. I had gone from being basically a perpetual underachiever in high school to a shining star in my new division. I owe a lot to Diana, who retired 2 years ago, as I probably wouldn't be in such a good place right now
          if she hadn't pulled me from where I was to work there.
        </p>
        <p class="leader">As time has gone on, though, I've increasingly wondered where my future direction will lead. It's certainly possible that I could remain a Staff Analyst for years until I decide to retire, but that would limit my earning potential. 
          I could attempt to promote to Senior Staff Analyst, but that is not an attractive prospect for me, as I've never really seen myself as a "leader" and am not particularly interested in supervisorial duties. My dad was a supervisor in a different
          department in the County, and hearing about his experiences as a supervisor have definitely put me off of that path. As I stated in my About Me bio in the Index page, I've always had an interest in web development and programming, so when online
          classes became more widely available after the pandemic, I seized my opportunity. Maybe I'll stay on a Staff Analyst and build some kind of side career with all of this knowledge I'm gaining. Maybe I'll jump careers entirely and go into web 
          development full-time, either as a developer for a company or in business for myself. Either way, for now, I am here, learning.
