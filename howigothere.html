        <p class="leader">I started working as a Staff Analyst for the Managed Care Division of the Department of Behavioral Health on July 18, 2016. It has proven to be a challenging, engaging job where I have many supportive, friendly co-workers. In years
          past, we have been a tight-knit, almost family-like division, probably one of the best to work at in the entire department, but as time has gone on, and some of our leadership has begun retiring, I'm not entirely certain what the division will look
          like in the future. My former boss, Diana, was one of those who retired, in February 2020. She was among the interviews present on the panel that I interviewed with. Diana was the one that ultimately made the decision to offer me a position, and 
          told me that it was largely based on how well I interviewed, the varied skillset I had presented, and the strength of the writing sample I had given prior to the interview. She was eager to have me join the division in its work to manage and
          maintain the Department's private mental health provider program. 
        </p>

        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <p><b>A photo taken just after I returned from my interview. Diana used to joke that she hired me because she was impressed by my outfit.</b></p>
        </div>
        <p class="leader">
          When I had first applied for Staff Analyst, I was actually quite nervous, not knowing exactly what I would be doing, nor if I would be able to handle the work. However, when I accepted the position to work for the Managed Care Division, I researched
          the division and found that the work would really not be so different from what I had been doing as an Eligibility Worker. Diana's patience and guidance during my first few weeks definitely quickly helped me reach my full potential as an analyst.
          I found that everything I had learned over the course of my life, whether in my free time, at school, from my dad, from my previous job, etc., now had a purpose and was serving me well those first few weeks and months. There were times when Diana
          was so impressed with my work she would almost literally cry, as if I had been exactly the type of analyst she had been looking for all this time. I had gone from being basically a perpetual underachiever in high school to a shining star in my new 
          division within just a few short years. I owe a lot to Diana, as I probably wouldn't be in such a good place right now if she hadn't hired me.
        </p>

          <p><b>I 3D printed the Disney/Cinderella Castle and painted it as a retirement gift to Diana, who loves all things Disney.</b></p>
        </div>
        <p class="leader">As time has gone on, though, I've increasingly wondered what I should do in the future. It's certainly possible that I could stay, and remain a Staff Analyst for years until I decide to retire, but that would limit my earning potential. 
          I'm also concerned about the future of the division and whether or not too many things will start to change, especially post-COVID, to where my job could become a bit unrecognizable to what it was in years past. I could also attempt to promote to 
          Senior Staff Analyst, either in this division or another division, but that is not an attractive prospect for me, as I've never really seen myself as a "leader" and am not particularly interested in supervisorial duties. My dad was a supervisor in 
          a different department in the County, and hearing about his experiences as a supervisor have definitely put me off of that path. As I stated in my About Me bio in the Index page, I've always had an interest in web development and programming, so 
          when online classes became more widely available after the pandemic, I seized my opportunity. Maybe I'll stay on a Staff Analyst and build some kind of side career with all of this knowledge I'm gaining. Maybe I'll jump careers entirely and go into 
          web development full-time, either as a developer for a company or in business for myself. Either way, for now, I am here, learning.
