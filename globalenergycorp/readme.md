# dev_1

My topic for dev_0 was a self-service gas station with an attached car wash (described in writing, of course), with an array of objects (customers with randomized money, fuel needs, and other values). It was pretty neat, but not really interactive at all, and very complex to update (I wrote it before we learned to separate functions from the rest of our code).

I liked the concept, so I was determine to keep it going for dev_1. Weeks 9-10 were the turning point where I decided that I could definitely keep that same concept going. After finishing Week 10, I figured I had more than enough knowledge to attempt a re-factor of the concept using DOM manipulation and localstorage, although I did start from scratch, referencing what I needed from dev_0 in a split view.

I started dev_1 by creating the page and the HTML first, adding the inputs that I knew I'd need, and then I started building the code around that. CRUD operations are used to allow the user to set their own gas prices and save them to localstorage, to store all customer-related data in localstorage, as well as for a surprise feature.
