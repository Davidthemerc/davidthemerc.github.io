        <p class="leader">My girlfriend's father has taken up residence in Tijuana, Mexico, where she and my future mother-in-law travel twice a year to visit him. As I'm soon going to be officially part of the family, I went with them
          on the last trip. We even brought the dogs (a pair of chihuahuas!) with us on this trip, as we were all going to be away for the weekend. We drove to the border crossing in Otay Mesa early Friday morning, which south of San 
          Diego, to drop off my mother-in-law so that she could meet up with my father-in-law right away. We then drove north into San Diego to go shopping for a few last minute necessities, eat lunch at Shake Shack (one of my favorite 
          chains that we don't have in Fresno), and then checked in to our Airbnb for the weekend. The next morning, we took the dogs to the Wag Hotel in San Diego to board them for the day, and headed for the Otay Mesa Border Crossing.
          We parked the car in a parking lot near the border and walked across the border.

          border. After crossing into Mexico, we took a taxi to Downtown Tijuana (Zona Central), where my in-laws were staying in a hotel.

          </div><p>After arriving in Zona Central and meeting up with my girlfriend's parents, our first order of business was to go out for some brunch. Our taxi driver had recommended a restaurant nearby called Super Antojitos, so we
            decided to go there. I searched for it on Google Maps, and it was about a mile away, so we started walking. The restaurant was tiny, so there was a somewhat long wait time, but once we were seated, ordered, and recieved our
            food, it was worth the wait. The food was delicious! As we later found out, I had picked the wrong Super Antojitos restaurant, as there was also one about half a mile away from where we had been! Oops!

          </div><p>After spending Saturday morning and afternoon in Tijuana with my girlfriend and future in-laws, we took an Uber back to the Otay Mesa border crossing. This is a picture I took of the line to cross back into the United
            States. It was about a 45 minute wait or so. There were a lot of vendors roaming about, selling various food and knick knacks. There was a guy singing with a loudspeaker, a father and daughter playing guitars and singing,
            and even a rap group that customized their lyrics based on the people they observed in line. As we inched closer to the border inspection point, a border patrol agent walked past with a drug-sniffing dog. We love dogs, so we
            couldn't help but be amused to see this pup working diligently at his job.

          </div><p>The next day, Sunday, we headed back to Tijuana, but this time we would be having lunch instead of breakfast. My girlfriend had spent a couple hours the night before researching where to eat, and settled upon La Tradicion,
            a restaurant near the Tijuana Arch in the Plaza Santa Cecilia. It was much closer than Super Antojitos; only about a 8-9 minute walk up Avenida Revolucion. There was no wait time upon our arrival, and we quickly settled in and 
            dove into the menu. We noticed that La Tradicion specializes in molcajetes; basically a stone mortar and pestle that is heated to keep the food warm, and filled past the brim with food. We ordered the Molcajete tradicional, which 
            was packed with chicken, chorizo, shrimp, Mexican cheese, cactus, rice, beans, etc. It was easily the best Mexican food I've ever had, and was probably my favorite part of the entire trip.
