        <p class="leader">After I graduated from college, I had what seemed like the longest summer vacation ever, from June 2013 to early December 2013. I was spending multiple hours per day job searching, of course, but in my mind, I figured I could
          only do so much, so I made sure to set a lot of time aside for recreational activities. I started applying for various County of Fresno jobs, such as Human Resources Analyst, Human Resources Technician, Administrative Analyst, etc., and took
          multiple County qualification tests to obtain an interview slot, but ultimately, I was unable to secure a position in any of those areas. By June, another job opened up for applications, Eligibility Worker. This was the same job that my dad
          originally applied for and was hired into shortly after we moved to Fresno. He pushed me to apply for that job, so I took the test and was able to rank and qualify for an interview. And then, I waited. And waited. And waited some more. I did
          not get a call for an interview until November, by which point the job had become open for applicants again. Evidently, I had just barely made the cut for this round of interviews.
        </p>

          <img src="/assets/img/fresnocounty.jpg" alt="" class="image75 pt-4">
        </div>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center pb-4">
          <p><b>The Fresno County Plaza, where I visited many, many times that summer to both interview, and take tests to qualify for an interview.</b></p>
        </div>
        <p class="leader">Luckily, I interviewed sufficiently well that I was offered an Eligibility Worker position, which I started on December 9, 2013. After two days of County induction training, I was given my assignment instructions. I was assigned
          to work at an office just a few miles from where I lived, which was very lucky! The day I reported to my new office, my co-workers were decorating the office Christmas tree. They were glad to have me there, not just as extra help to manage the
          workload, but because I was tall and could help with the tree decorations as well! Within a few weeks of working there, I was assigned to job training, which is where I got the background photo for this page. The photo is of my training cohort,
          which completed training back in May 2014. Eligibility basically process paperwork for people applying for public benefits (such as CalFresh/Food Stamps and Medi-Cal) and determine whether or not they are eligible to receive those benefits. I 
          worked there for a little over 2 and a half years, when I then had the opportunity to apply for a Staff Analyst job in the late spring of 2016. I had actually applied for the same job in 2015, the year prior, but even after multiple rounds of
          interviews, I was not offered a position. In retrospect, it simply wasn't my time yet. 2016, however, definitely was, and that is where my story goes next.
