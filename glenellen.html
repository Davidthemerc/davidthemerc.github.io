        <!-- ======= Main Paragraph Text ======= -->
        <p class="leader">A few weeks after our vacation in Cambria, my girlfriend expressed a desire to take a trip to Wine Country, but not by staying at a regular hotel, and preferably somewhere a bit more quiet and less crowded.
          After an extensive search of the area, I found a place that perfectly fit the bill. Glen Ellen, is about 10 minutes drive north of Sonoma, and is probably one of the best kept secrets in Wine Country. I booked a stay at the
          Glen Ellen Inn, which has a number of "secret" cottages available for reservation. There are about four or five of them tucked behind the Glen Ellen Inn's restuarant and bar. We stayed at the Creekside cottage, which has a
          view of the local creek that runs through Glen Ellen. After I booked the stay, I found a local winery, Schermeister Winery, and scheduled a tasting for our first full day there. I noticed that there were also plenty of hiking
          trails in the area, which was perfect as the weather was set to be perfect.

              </div></a>
          </div><p>During my research into Glen Ellen, one of the first places in town that grabbed my attention was a little cafe called 'Les Pascals Patisserie et Boulangerie'. Pictured here are some fresh made quiches from Les Pascals.
            The cafe is run by a French couple who together have decades of experience working in the patiesserie business. Reviews for Les Pascals were spotless, so I knew I had found a real gem. My girlfriend loves going to French style
            bakeries and cafes and I knew this is exactly the kind of place she would want to go during our trip. We ordered so many pastries that there were probably enough for a small team meeting, but they were all so delicious. The
            quiches were easily the best I've ever had.

              </div></a>
          </div><p>One of the other great things I found about Glen Ellen was the abundance of hiking trails within walking distance of the Glen Ellen Inn. We followed some directions we were given; a short walk later through a
            quiet neighborhood and adjacent easement, we found ourselves on the Sonoma Valley Regional Park Trail headed towards Lake Suttonfield, where I took this picture of an American Wigeon. There were actually dozens of them swimming
            around in the lake, it was quite a sight to see. I actually remembered to pack my digital camera on this trip, so I was able to snap this photo from quite far away!

              </div></a>
          </div><p>At the end of hike to the lake, we walked south and around the creek to eat at a nearby restaurant, The Mill at Glen Ellen. I had a Wagyu Steak Burger, but the real highlight of The Mill was dessert. I ordered the Burnt
            Basque Cheesecake, which is probably the best cheesecake I've eaten anywhere (including the several types of cheesecakes I've tried at the Cheesecake Factory!) Normally I'm so full after eating lunch or dinner, that I almost
            never have room for dessert, but our server specifically recommended the cheesecake to us, and I love cheesecake, so I could not resist. I opened up my belt a bit and ordered it, and had absolutely no regrets. If you ever visit
            Glen Ellen and you're a fan of cheese, go there and try it! You won't regret it!
