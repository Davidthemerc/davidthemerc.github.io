          <p class="d-flex justify-content-center leader">I first took an interest in creative writing after reading some of the works of Ernest Hemingway in English class, in my 4th semester at Fresno City College. I had written about three or four
            of them when I got the message from Fresno City that I could register for classes for the next semester, Fall 2010. While browsing for classes, I noticed that Fresno City offered a Creative Writing (Short Stories) class, which couldn't have
            been better timing for me! It was nice to participate in a class full of fellow writers, all there simply for the love of writing. I got a lot of compliments for my writing, which up until that point, I had never really been too sure about.
            I'll be including short samples of the writing I made from that class below.

            </div>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
              <p><b>Being stood up is never fun. But what if there was a good reason?</b></p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="interest-subheader pt-4 pb-2">Multiple Perspectives</h4>
          <p>“Why the hell didn't you show up last night?”  It was a rather simple question my date asked me, but one that had no simple answer. I had tried to make it to the restaurant on time, but I couldn't. Somewhere between the bus exploding on the freeway and the ten car pileup that ensued, I knew I wasn't going to make it. She didn't really give a damn why though; to her I was simply an hour late. I didn't feel like arguing back, so I just left.</p>
          <p>A young woman was seated alone at a table for two. She had been tapping on the table for over twenty minutes, staring at the nearby wall clock periodically. She had quite the number of angry thoughts on her mind, and assumed her date didn't care if he was late or not. When he did eventually show up, she wasted no time in unloading each and every one of them onto his weary shoulders. Hearing her rants, he didn't bother to explain what had kept him, so he merely turned away and left her alone at the table.</p>
          <p>The nearby table was the scene of a heated argument. A young woman seated at the table was busy yelling at a man standing over her. His clothes were covered in a layer of dust, he looked to be in miserable condition. She questioned him. “So are you going to explain why you were late, or are you just going to stand there?” The man raised his finger and started to open his mouth, but instead turned away and left without escalation. It wasn't the most interesting incident to have happened in a restaurant.</p>
          <p>The young woman always hated it when her dates were late. It always made her feel less important, and lent the feeling of being stood up until they finally did show up. She would never let herself appear weak; whenever someone was late she was always very vocal and angry about it. This time was no different. Had she known that her date was held up by a bus explosion and subsequent series of car accidents, she might have been more forgiving. When he finally arrived and tried to explain what had happened, she sounded off. He cared about her too much to let his emotions explode out at her, so he left and decided to tell her about it tomorrow. She would be calmer in the morning.</p>
