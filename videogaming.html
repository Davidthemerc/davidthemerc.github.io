        <p class="leader p-3">I'd be kidding myself completely if I didn't just come out and say that video gaming has been just a hobby for me. For a lot of my life, it's been more of a lifestyle, or even an obsession!
          There were a lot of years (particularly my college years) where I never really felt like being social in the traditional sense (that is, actually making friends and talking to people in real life), even 
          if I was surrounded by crowds of people at Fresno City and Fresno State. In those years, if you wanted to reach me, it would be vastly easier to reach me online! Where on the internet, you might ask?

    <a class="pb-4 menulink" href="https://www.runescape.com">RuneScape (The Free MMORPG - RuneScape - Online Fantasy RPG)</a>
    </div><p>RuneScape is unequivically my favorite computer/video game of all time. I've been playing it since January 2005, which was my freshman year in high school. My peers and I were introduced to the game at an open computer lab 
      (held during lunch hours) which I often went to with my friends. Over the years, most of them stopped playing the game, but I have kept at it. I haven't played it constantly since 2005 (I've had breaks during my Fresno State years 
      where I needed to focus on school work, for example), but I've always come back to RuneScape at one point or another. RuneScape has actually split into two games, RuneScape 3 (a more modernized version of the game, as seen in the
      first image), and Old School RuneScape, a throwback, retro version of the game circa 2007, but I have spent plenty of time playing both versions and will continue to do so in the future.

          Basically, imagine if the entire world was made of blocks, and you could easily manipulate the world around you. You could also describe it as the entire world as if it were made out of Legos. I always loved playing with Legos
          as a child, and Minecraft is essentially the modern computer version of that. You can play the game solo, or online with dozens of people. There are many hundreds of online servers out there to choose from, each with its own
          community, so there's a pretty good chance that you can find a group of like-minded people to play Minecraft with.

        </p><p>
          Foxhole is a quasi-World War 2 era sandbox warfare game. Every foxhole, every fortification, every gun, every ammo magazine, every medkit in the game is created by players. Every item carried by players in the game has to be
          delivered either by land or sea. The entire war effort is essentially managed by the players. It can get pretty chaotic at times, but the amount of freedom the game affords is immense. You could be fighting on the front lines
          of a major battle one afternoon, retreating by evening, and delivering new supplies from home bases in the "backline" to the frontline by nightfall. No video game can every truly capture the experience of warfare, but Foxhole
          does a fair job in showcasing the chaos of war, and what it takes to supply troops on the frontlines with supplies that they need.

        </p><p>I've always been a big Trekkie since my dad introduced me to the Original Series and the movies that followed. I discovered this game during winter break of 2011-2012, and still play it on occasion. In this game, you can create
          your own Starfleet (or Klingon!) captain, take command of your own ship, and carry out missions just like the TV show. Of course, as it's a game, a lot of those missions tend to be more action packed than your typical Star Trek episode
          (I've probably gotten in more space battles in a single day of playing the game than Captain Picard did in an average season of The Next Generation), but that's perfectly fine with me. Not too many people want to play a Star Trek game to
          spend all day "negotiating" (myself included!)
